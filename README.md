## 🥖 git-explain

**See your contribution status across repositories at a glance.**

Ever wonder which repos in a folder are yours, which are forks, and which are just clones you grabbed and forgot about? `git-explain` rises to the occasion.

### What it shows

- 🔍 **Your commits** — how many commits you've made (by matching your `user.email`)
- 🍴 **Fork detection** — identifies repos where you have an upstream remote
- ☁️ **Your remotes** — highlights remotes containing your GitHub username
- 📝 **Dirty status** — staged, modified, untracked files with line counts
- ⬆️ **Unpushed commits** — don't leave your dough unproofed
- 📦 **Stashes** — forgotten stashes you should deal with

### Requirements

Set your git identity so git-explain knows who you are:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global github.user "yourusername"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Analyze all repos in a directory
git explain ~/projects

# Analyze a single repo with verbose output
git explain ~/projects/my-repo -v

# Show as a table
git explain ~/projects -t

# Output as JSON
git explain ~/projects --json

# Get advice on what to do
git explain ~/projects --advice

# Get LLM-powered advice (requires OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
git explain ~/projects --llm-advice

# Use Anthropic instead of OpenAI
git explain ~/projects --llm-advice --llm-provider anthropic

# Add custom personality to LLM advice
git explain ~/projects --llm-advice --llm-instructions "be encouraging and use baking puns"
```

## 🥯 git-id

**Manage git identity profiles for multi-account workflows.**

Juggling personal and work GitHub accounts? `git-id` stores identity profiles in your git config so you can switch contexts without kneading through config files.

### What it stores

Each profile can have:
- 🔑 **SSH key** — path to the private key for this identity
- 📧 **Email** — git author/committer email
- 👤 **User** — git author/committer name
- 🐙 **GitHub user** — username for `gh-as`

### Usage

```bash
# List all profiles
git-id

# Create a new profile interactively
git-id add personal

# Show profile details
git-id show personal

# Set a single field
git-id set personal email me@example.com

# Remove a profile
git-id remove personal
```

### Example output

```
$ git-id
  personal: me@example.com (gh: myuser ✓)
  work: me@company.com (gh: work-user ✓)

$ git-id show personal
Profile: personal
Source:  /Users/me/.gitconfig

  sshkey: ~/.ssh/id_personal ✓
  email:  me@example.com
  user:   My Name
  ghuser: myuser ✓ authenticated
```

## 🥨 git-as

**Run git commands with a specific identity.**

Use your identity profiles to run git commands with the right SSH key and email — no more pushing with the wrong account.

### Usage

```bash
# Clone with your personal identity
git-as personal clone git@github.com:user/repo.git

# Push with your work identity
git-as work push origin main

# Commit as a specific identity
git-as personal commit -m "Fix bug"
```

### How it works

`git-as` sets environment variables and execs git:
- `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` — uses the profile's SSH key
- `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` / `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` — uses the profile's email
- `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` — uses the profile's name (if set)

---

## 🥞 gh-as

**Run GitHub CLI commands with a specific identity.**

Switch between authenticated GitHub accounts for `gh` commands.

### Requirements

The GitHub user must be authenticated with `gh auth login` before use.

### Usage

```bash
# List PRs as your personal account
gh-as personal pr list

# Create an issue as your work account
gh-as work issue create

# Clone a repo as a specific user
gh-as personal repo clone owner/repo
```

### How it works

`gh-as` creates a temporary config directory with a `hosts.yml` that selects the specified user, then execs `gh` with `GH_CONFIG_DIR` pointing to it.

## 🍴 gh-wtfork

**What the fork? Analyze your GitHub forks.**

You've accumulated mass amounts of repositories after years of compulsive open source contribution. You no longer know what's yours and what's not. Tell apart the projects you're actively maintaining from that fork you made in 2010 to correct a typo.

### What it shows

`gh-wtfork` categorizes your forks into three groups:

- **Maintained** — you're ahead on the default branch (keeping your own version)
- **Contributions** — not ahead, but has branches or PRs (contributing back upstream)
- **Untouched** — no changes at all (can probably delete)

For each fork, you'll see:
- How far ahead/behind upstream, and *when* (is upstream dead? is your fork stale?)
- Your branches with age and associated PR status (open, merged, or closed)
- Whether that old branch is finished business or still pending

### Usage

```bash
# Show active forks (hides untouched ones)
gh-wtfork

# Show all forks including untouched
gh-wtfork --all

# Run as a specific identity
gh-wtfork --as work

# Output as JSON
gh-wtfork --json
```

### Example output

```
